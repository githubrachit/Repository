                <span>&#8226;</span> <strong>Brief description</strong><br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>If You have opted for Return of Premium Option and once this Policy has acquired the Surrender Value, then, You will be eligible for grant of loans from Us.<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>The minimum amount of loan which can be granted by Us under this Policy is INR 10,000 (Rupees Ten Thousand). In no event shall the maximum amount of loan which can be granted under this Policy during the Policy Term exceed 75% (Seventy-Five percent) of the Surrender Value payable under this Policy, subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by Us from time to time.<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>Upon grant of a loan under this Policy, this Policy shall automatically be assigned in Our favour, till the time the entire loan amount including interest, any fees or dues towards such loan has been repaid to Us. On repayment of the entire loan and accumulated interest to Us, if any, this Policy will be reassigned to You.<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>If You have obtained a loan under this Policy, then,You are required to pay interest on such loan. The interest on the loan will be compounded and applied annually on the Policy Anniversary at the rates as prescribed by Us at the time of taking the loan.<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>The loan interest rate shall be equal to applicable 'RBI Bank Rate' plus 3.0%. The current loan interest rate is 9.75% p.a. compounded annually and is based on 'RBI Bank Rate' of 6.75% p.a. prevailing as at 31st March 2024. The 'RBI Bank Rate' for the financial year ending 31st March (every year) will be considered for determining the loan interest rate and the same shall be made effective w.e.f. 01st July every year. The loan interest rate is revised only if the 'RBI Bank Rate' changes by 1% or more from the 'RBI Bank Rate' used to determine the prevailing loan interest rate (reviewed on every 31st March).<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>For Reduced Paid Up Mode policies, if the outstanding loan amount granted to You and accumulated interest on such loan exceed the Surrender Value, the Policy will terminate. In case outstanding loan amount including accumulated interest on such loan exceeds 95% of the Surrender Value or the remaining Policy Term is 6 months (whichever is earlier), We will send You a communication for repayment of loan along with the accrued interest.<br><br>
                <span>&#10146;</span>If You have not opted for Return of Premium Option, You are not entitled to any loans under this Policy.<br>
