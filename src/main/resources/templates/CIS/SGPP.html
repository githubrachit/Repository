                <p>In case of 'Joint Life Immediate Annuity for life (with Death Benefit)' as Annuity Option, then within 3 months from the date of death of any of the Annuitants, the surviving Annuitant will have an option to receive the present value of Annuity payable in next 5 Policy Years as advance Annuity amount, which will be computed as per the below formula:</p>
                <p>Advance annuity amount = 4.00 x Annuity instalment x number of Annuities payable per Policy Year</p>
                <p>The interest rate applicable to arrive at the advance annuity amount is the weighted average pricing interest rate of all age/premium bands. Currently this discount rate is 7.85 % per annum.</p>
                <p>Once this option is selected, the advance Annuity amount will be payable immediately in lump sum. It is clarified that the Annuity amount payable, if any, during the Policy Year of exercising this option shall continue as and when due as per the Schedule.</p>
                <p>Once the lump sum advance Annuity amount is paid, the Annuity payment during the next 5 Policy Years shall stop from the Policy Anniversary. The regular Annuity payouts shall start after the expiry of the above said 5 Policy Years as per the original terms and conditions of the Policy.</p>
                <p>In case of death of the surviving Annuitant or Surrender of Policy anytime during the above 5 Policy Years, We will pay the applicable death/Surrender benefit after adjusting the remaining advance Annuity amount. Remaining advance Annuity amount will be calculated as per the below formula:</p>
                <p>Remaining advance Annuity amount = (1- months elapsed during advance Annuity period/60) x advance Annuity amount</p>
                <p>For National Pension System subscriber, payment of advance Annuity amount shall be subject to regulations, guidelines or other directions issued by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.</p>

                <p>The Annuity paid from the Top Up Premium will be dependent on the Age of the Annuitant(s) and annuity rate prevailing for the respective Annuity option, at the time of Top Up Premium payment.</p>
